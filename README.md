# 📈 Time Series Stock Market Analysis  

This repository contains my **final project submission** on **Stock Market Time Series Analysis**.  
The project uses **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for analysis & forecasting, and **Power BI** for building an interactive dashboard.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to:
- Perform **time series analysis** on stock price data  
- Apply forecasting models like **ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet**  
- Compare forecasting results from different models  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize stock trends & insights  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `fbprophet`  
- **Power BI** (interactive dashboard)  
- **CSV datasets** for storing forecasts
